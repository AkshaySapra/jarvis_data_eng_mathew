# Springboot Trading App UI with React

The purpose of this app is to provide a web-based UI for interacting with the Springboot trading API
which was developed in a previous Jarvis project. This project uses Node.js' standalone web server,
and is based on the `create-react-app` template.

This project serves as an introduction to modern Javascript using Node.js and React, as well as
some rudimentary HTML and CSS.

This project is in development.
